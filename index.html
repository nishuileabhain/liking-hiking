<p>link text background position again using intellisense.
And we want it to be in the center. We'd also like the image just to appear once,
we don't want it to tile across the background, so we're going to set
background-repeat to no-repeat, and finally for this we're also going to set
the background-size to cover the container that it's sitting inside. We're
going to give our image a min-height of 360 pixels, and there's going to be a
relationship here as well with this 360 pixels to the right hand side of the
image. We're going to have three layouts, and they'll combine to form a height of
360 pixels as well. We'll also just add a little bit of animation for when the
page is loading, or when the image is loading rather, and we'll copy and paste
that twice. Just so that we can add our browser prefixes our vendor prefixes to
make sure that it works in all browsers so we'll use -moz
and -webkit as well. Okay, so let's save our changes. We can go back
to our previous preview, refresh the page and
image appears correctly. It takes up one-third on the left-hand side of the
screen, leaving us with two-thirds on the other side. So, we're good to go.
In our next video then we'll continue working on the header and look at the
other two thirds of the screen.</p>
